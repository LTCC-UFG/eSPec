\chapter{Introduction}
The \textsc{e\textit{SP}ec} program was developed to solve the nuclear problem based on time dependent perturbation theory. The main feature implemented in this program intends to construct eletron-vibrational spectra of molecules. The spectrum can be built by: (a) the time dependent formalism which does the propagation of the wave function in the time domain; or (b) the time independet formalism which solves the relevant eigenstates in the energy space. 

In the next section is presented the theory, and in the subsequent ones are shown how to compile and use the program, as well as, explanations about the numerical methods used and exemples of applications. Finally it is given a general conclusion about the methods related with the solution of radiation/matter interaction.
